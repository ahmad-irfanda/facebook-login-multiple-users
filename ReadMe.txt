Facebook Login with looping for case multiple user in database

- run / click the file "facebook-login-with-looping.html" in the browser 
so that the javascript file can run.

Notice : 
The newsfeed's display will appear after a successful login because function "console.log". 
it'll appears on the console not on the html page. 
if you use google chrome, the console can be accessed by entering 
into developer mode (Ctrl + Shift + i) and pressing the console tab.

I hope this will be useful for you.
